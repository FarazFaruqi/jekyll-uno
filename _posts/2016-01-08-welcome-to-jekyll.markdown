Hey! Faraz Faruqi here. 

I am a first year Computer Science Ph.D. student at MIT, where I am working with [Prof. Stefanie Mueller](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/) at CSAIL. My research interests lie at the intersection of digital fabrication and machine learning for HCI. I aim to design sociable, intelligent and interactive technologies that improve and scaffold human capabilities. 
Prior to MIT, I have worked in leading research labs in HCI with specializations ranging from embodied conversational agents to personal fabrication, where I collaborated with graduate and post-graduate researchers in finding solutions to problems ranging from creating virtual collaborative child agents to creating deep learning systems to classify and generate humorous texts. 
Interested in these topics and wanna chat? Send me an [email](mailto:ffaruqi@mit.edu) and I would be happy to Zoom!
