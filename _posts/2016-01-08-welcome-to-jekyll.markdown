Hi! I am Faraz Faruqi, a Computer Science Enthusiast. I am an incoming senior at Manipal Institute of Technology. Like a soul in tension that's learning to fly, I am trying to find my own place in this rich field of computer science. I love learning about new technological innovations, and talking to people associated with computer science and engineering. I love to experiment with new things and concepts, and collaborate with people doing such cutting-edge research. To keep myself invigorated and functional, I love to play soccer, hike, and play the piano.
