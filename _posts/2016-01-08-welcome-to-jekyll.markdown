Hi! I am Faraz Faruqi, a Computer Science Enthusiast with prior research experience in Human-Computer Interaction, NLP and Machine-Learning. Currently, I am a Visiting student in the [HCI Engineering Group](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/) led by Prof. Stefanie Mueller at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, MIT. I aim to design sociable, intelligent and interactive technologies that improve and scaffold human capabilities. I have worked in leading research labs in HCI with specializations ranging from embodied conversational agents to personal fabrication, where I collaborated with graduate and post-graduate researchers in finding solutions to problems ranging from creating virtual collaborative child agents to creating novel interfaces to explore 3D printing models.
